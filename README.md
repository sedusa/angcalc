# angcalc v1.0
AngCalc is a simple calculator I built using AngularJS, jQuery and Bootstrap to help with quick calculations for the medical billing insurance claims process for [Samalla Clinic Ltd.](http://www.samallaclinic.com) I decided to use a bright color palette and large numbers to make the calculation process very easy even when using the app on a mobile device.
